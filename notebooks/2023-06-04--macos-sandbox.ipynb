    "This post covers some experimentation I did with the MacOS `sandbox-exec` command. The goal is to be able to run and evaluate Python libraries while significantly reducing the risk of a supply chain attack installing malware on my computer or exfiltrating data from my computer.\n",

    "## Bash Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The bash script I wrote that inspired this post can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/lucaswiman/1cec6584015149f0df1bb24c875a0709). Please comment with improvements/suggestions!\n",

    "\n",
    "The DSL used by `sandbox-exec` must start with `(version 1)`, seemingly the only version in existence as of 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules consist of parenthesis-enclosed rules of the form `([deny/allow] [permissions] [predicates])`. Later rules have higher precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important permissions are:\n",
    "* `default`: Matches any permission, e.g. `(allow default)` or `(deny default)`. The latter is probably useful for running untrusted code (e.g. a new pypi library).\n",
    "* `file*`:\n",
    "  * `file-read-metadata`, `file-read-data`, ...\n",
    "  * `file-write-data`, ...\n",
    "* `network*`:\n",
    "  * `network-outbound`, e.g. `(deny network-outbound (remote ip \"*:80\"))` disallows outbound connections to port 80.\n",
    "  * `network-bind`. You probably want to leave this one `deny` unless you know you need it, so granting `network-*` is probably overly broad.\n",
    "* `sysctl-read`. This is needed for code intended to run on multiple OSes, e.g. Python's `os.uname()` method fails without this permission. I don't know how to make this more restricted. You probably don't want to grant `sysctl-write` if you can avoid it.\n",
    "* `mach*` and `ipc-posix-shm`. I needed to grant these to allow audio (see bash script below), though I'm ignorant of what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions support globbing, e.g. `file*` grants `file-read-data` and `file-write-data` permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most complete listing can be found in [this reverse engineered guide](https://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v1.0.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "These are enclosed in parentheses:\n",
    "* `(literal \"some literal\")`\n",
    "* `(subpath \"/path/to/dir\")`\n",
    "* `(regex #\"^/usr/lib/*\")`\n",
    "* `([remote/local] ip \"host:port\")`, e.g. `(remote ip \"*:80\")`. Annoyingly, the host must be either `*` or `localhost`, which makes it impossible to only allow particular hosts. There exist firewalling applications which can do that for particular processes, but alas not supported here.\n",
    "* `(require-any [predicates])` or `(require-all [predicates])` disjunction/conjunction of predicates.\n",
